Model in repository is named: RANDOMFORESTMODEL.sav. To open model, the pickle library was used.

Api view requires 8 different keys and its values, i.e: HighBP, HighChol, Stroke, GenHlth, PhysHlth, DiffWalk, Sex, Age.

HighBP, HighChol, Stroke, Sex, DiffWalk  are the answers : 0,1 in most cases No-Yes. GenHlth and Age are categorical values. Last but not least PhysHlth is number of days in range 0-30.
## Frontend
Frontend was implemented in React.js. In addition particles.tx and CSS templates were used for funny appearance.

## How does it work?
We just answer the questions provided on webpage and then, when everything is set we press "Sprawd≈∫" button.

The output always will be in percentage, which is the chance to get heart disease.
